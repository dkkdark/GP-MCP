### Steps to set up the project:

1. Set up the environment. I followed the steps described here: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk
2. Install the requirements from requirements.txt
3. Run the server using 'python server.py'. You should see: "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000"
4. Run the chat using 'streamlit run streamlit.py'. You should be redirected to a browser


You also need OpenAI api key in your environment.
